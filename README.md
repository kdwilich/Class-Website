# Class-Website
A website created with the intention of implementing new and helpful features that could be brought to students through a website

It needs to be accessed from a host in order to have access to the databases, so below is the website URl:
http://74.117.171.117/~maks740/finalProject/resources.php

At the login page, a new user can be created and then used to login and view the classroom materials.

A forum page is included that shows lets users ask questions and also answer questions that have been previously posted.

A Lecture recordings page is included where the teacher can record then upload their lectures for students to view in case they missed something.

A Materials page is included that shows the syllabus and whatever videos/articles the teacher might find necessary.

There is an administrative account that has access to creating/uploading new content or deleting forum posts while the regular student accounts are only able to view the given content.
